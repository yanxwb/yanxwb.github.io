My name is Yanbo Wang, and I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong University. After graduation, I will be pursuing a Ph.D. at Peking University under the guidance of Prof. [Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/).

During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [Collegiate Programming Contest school team](https://board.xjtuicpc.com/) and [LUD](https://luoundergradxjtu.github.io/) at Xi'an Jiaotong University. My research interests primarily focus on graph neural networks, and I am always eager to discuss and exchange ideas with others in the field. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in discussing further!
