Hello, I'm Yanbo Wang, a dedicated Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, fortunate to be guided by Prof. [Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/).

My academic journey began when I joined Xi'an Jiaotong University through the Honors Youth Program, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of being part of the [Collegiate Programming Contest school team](https://board.xjtuicpc.com/) and [LUD](https://luoundergradxjtu.github.io/) at Xi'an Jiaotong University, which greatly enriched my experience.

My research passion centers around graph neural networks, and I'm always enthusiastic about engaging in discussions and idea exchange with fellow enthusiasts in this field. If you share this interest or would like to connect for any reason, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's collaborate and explore the world of computer science together!
